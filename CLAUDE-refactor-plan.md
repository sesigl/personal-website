- refactor: follow clean code principles, replace comments that can be replaced by private methods, and remove unnecessary comments. If exracting a class or something else is needed, do it.
- reafctor: cleanup tests, ensure there is a single way to get a database test instance that is cleaned up after each test, and ensure that the tests are readable and maintainable. Reduce duplicated code.
- refactor: PostgresNewsletterClient is rather a repository about Contacts. rename it to PostgresContactsRepository and update other ependencies and code usages as well to ensure there is no confusion.
- refactor: the newsletter application service has far too much logic. Following DDD principles, extract the logic into a domain class or service and ensure that the application service is thin and only orchestrates the calls to the domain service.
