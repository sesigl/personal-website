In software development, there's a popular saying that "complexity kills."

Imagine you need to introduce new features into your application. Against your expectations, the process of
implementation, testing, and deployment stretches over several weeks rather than days. This extended timeline can
become even more problematic if the newly deployed changes cause the application to fail, frustrating users and
potentially leading them to abandon the application.

Such nightmares, often caused by tight coupling, showcase the peril of interconnectedness between different components
of a system. Tightly coupled components can trigger cascading changes when even the smallest modification occurs,
leading to significant maintenance headaches.

This blog post aims to unravel the concept of coupling, examine its forms, illustrate its effects with practical
examples, and provide strategies to balance coupling and decoupling in your software projects.

## What is Coupling?

Before we get into the details, let’s start with the basics to get a common understanding of what coupling is.

Coupling occurs when two software elements depend on each other such that a change in one requires a change in the other.

Let’s look at an example:

```typescript
function formatData(data: string): string {
    return data.toUpperCase();
}

function displayData() {
    const rawData = "hello";
    // displayData is tightly coupled to formatData
    const formattedData = formatData(rawData);
    console.log(formattedData);
}

displayData();  // Outputs: HELLO
```

In this example:

-	displayData function is tightly coupled to formatData functionality in regards to its string formatting.
-	displayData directly relies on formatData to process its data (converts it to uppercase).
-	If the formatData function’s implementation changes (e.g., it starts to format data differently or expects different
parameters), it could directly affect the behaviour of displayData.

This coupling makes displayData less flexible and more dependent on the specific behavior of formatData. Reducing this
coupling can be done by passing the dependency as a parameter, for instance:

```typescript
function formatData(data: string): string {
    return data.toUpperCase();
}

function displayData(formatter: (data: string) => string) {
    const rawData = "hello";
    // Using the formatter function passed as a parameter
    const formattedData = formatter(rawData);
    console.log(formattedData);
}

displayData(formatData);  // Outputs: HELLO
```

In the refactored version, displayData now accepts any function that matches the (data: string) => string signature, thus reducing its coupling with formatData. This approach enhances modularity and the ability to replace or modify the formatting function without altering the displayData function’s code.

It's essential to note that coupling, by itself, is required to implement a feature, which provides functionality for users of an application. It often arises from legitimate design decisions to achieve specific goals. How strong the coupling is depends on more details as you have seen it in the example before.

However, to understand coupling correctly, it's crucial to provide context, as in "Component A is coupled to Component B **with respect to a particular change**."

To understand the importance of Context analysing coupling of components let’s consider the following two examples to demonstrate why context matters:

### A bad example defining coupling

_"The User module is coupled to the Order module."_

This statement lacks clear information on the nature of the coupling. It does not specify what type of relationship exists or what changes could affect the other. The lack of detail means it could refer to anything like data sharing, method calls, or an event-driven relationship. Without understanding how these modules are coupled, it’s challenging to assess the impact of potential changes.

### A good example defining coupling

_"The User module is coupled to the Order module regarding database schema changes because both modules rely on the shared users table."_

This version makes it clear that a change in the users table schema (e.g., renaming a column or modifying data types) will require updates to queries or methods in both modules. Understanding this context allows developers to estimate the potential impact of schema changes, ensuring coordinated updates in both modules and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.

## Types of Coupling

To talk more detailed about coupling, it’s useful to separate coupling in 2 categories: static coupling and dynamic coupling. Let’s look at both in the 2 following sections.

### Static Coupling

When dependencies occur at compile time, typically via imports or static references to classes, methods, or data structures, it’s called static coupling.

A typical example is a calling another class’s method:

```typescript
// Data Processor
import { DataTransformer } from 'external-library';

class DataProcessor {
    private transformer: DataTransformer = new DataTransformer();

    public process(): void {
        this.transformer.transformData();
    }
}

export { DataProcessor };
```

If the external library changes the signature of transformData, the DataProcessor class will require an update and recompilation.

### Dynamic Coupling

When dependencies arise at runtime, usually through communication protocols, contracts, deployments, or specific data exchanges, it’s called dynamic coupling.

An example for dynamic coupling is when a service calls another service via a REST API:

```typescript
const SERVICE_B_URL = "https://example.com/api/serviceB";

class ServiceA {
    public getDataFromServiceB(): string {
        // Simplified example using a basic HTTP request
        // Note: In a real-world scenario, you'd handle async/await or Promises properly.
        return HttpClient.get(SERVICE_B_URL + "/data");
    }
}

export { ServiceA };
```

If ServiceB changes its endpoint paths or modifies the response format, ServiceA will need to update its calling logic.

## Practical Impact of Coupling

What does this mean for developers in practice? Whether you're working solo or as part of a team, the goal is to quickly
add more functionality without causing disruptions. However, as your application expands, this becomes increasingly
challenging. Consider a scenario where you want to implement a change but find yourself needing to:

- Deploy multiple parts of your system due to dynamic coupling when updating a specific module,
- Modify how another part of the system retrieves data from the database,
- Enhance performance to address slowing elements in the user interface,
- rectify failing tests.

Many of us have encountered these situations, and there's nothing inherently wrong with them. It’s about recognizing
patterns and understanding that it’s often coupling that complicates matters.

Coupling has both practical benefits and challenges, significantly impacting software design and maintenance.
Understanding how it affects your system helps you make informed architectural decisions.

### Irrelevant Coupling

Some forms of coupling might exist but have little to no practical impact on the current system, similar to a
"boulder at the top of a hill that never rolls down." For instance, if two modules are coupled to accommodate a rare
feature change that has never occurred in production, this coupling remains dormant and doesn’t affect day-to-day
operations.

### Cascade Effect

A significant risk with tight coupling is the cascade effect, where a change in one module necessitates further changes
in other related modules.

![Cascade effect of coupling](/images/posts/understand-coupling/cascading-effects.webp)

Consider a shared utility library used across various services. If a core utility function
like formatDate is modified (e.g., changing the date format), every service using this function must be updated
accordingly. This effect requires significant testing and coordination to avoid unexpected breakages.

### 1-to-N Coupling

An individual element can be linked to many others. For example, an authentication module may expose a function like
verifyCredentials, used by multiple services that rely on user identity. If the verification logic is altered
(e.g., changing encryption standards), every service consuming this function needs adjustments.

### Analysis Complexity

Understanding how coupling impacts your codebase isn't always straightforward. It requires carefully analysing
source code and observing past or likely changes. A change in one component may have unforeseen effects on others,
especially in large systems where dependencies are not immediately clear.

These practical implications highlight the importance of balancing the benefits and challenges of coupling to create
maintainable, scalable systems. Tight coupling isn’t always bad; however, understanding its potential impact and
managing it wisely are critical.

## Balancing Coupling and Decoupling

When managing the architecture of a software system, striking the right balance between coupling and decoupling is
crucial. While tight coupling offers efficiency, decoupling often improves maintainability and scalability.

### Cost vs. Benefits

Tight coupling can provide rapid development by directly connecting components or modules with minimal abstraction.
However, this comes at the cost of increased maintenance, as any modification can require changes throughout the
entire system. Hence, reducing coupling between components is critical for maintaining flexibility and ease of maintenance.

![Cost and effects of coupling](/images/posts/understand-coupling/effort-coupling.png)

Initially, the effort required to achieve significant coupling reduction is relatively low, generating substantial value. This phase
often involves straightforward refactoring and restructuring, which can significantly improve code quality and system
modularity with minimal investment.

However, as the reduction of coupling progresses, the associated costs begin to rise. This increase occurs because
subsequent improvements typically require more intricate changes, such as redesigning system architecture, reworking
dependencies, and extensive testing to ensure stability. The more deeply intertwined the components, the more complex
and resource-intensive the decoupling efforts become.

Therefore, it's crucial to identify the "sweet spot" where the balance between effort, cost, and value is optimized.
Beyond this point, additional coupling reduction yields diminishing returns, with costs escalating disproportionately
compared to the benefits.Effective project management and a strategic approach to coupling reduction can help in finding
this optimal balance, ensuring that the system remains flexible and maintainable without incurring excessive costs.

### Legitimate Coupling

Some forms of coupling are justified and arise naturally from system requirements. For instance, a user
authentication module must inherently depend on a database module to verify credentials. In this case, coupling
helps the authentication module retrieve the necessary data while still being constrained to a specific structure.

### Trade-offs

Decoupling everything is not practical and may lead to overengineering, which introduces unnecessary layers of
abstraction. This can result in overly complex designs that are difficult to understand and maintain. Instead, focus on
coupling where efficiency is needed and on decoupling where flexibility and resilience are paramount. For instance,
given your goal is to support multiple payment providers, a payment gateway might use a standard interface to integrate
multiple payment providers while directly connecting to other internal modules.

Ultimately, managing coupling requires careful consideration of the needs of your system. Identifying critical areas
where changes are frequent or expected and balancing these with modules that are more stable can significantly improve
architectural decisions.

## Conclusion

Coupling is a fundamental aspect of software engineering that directly impacts system architecture and maintainability.
By understanding the different types of coupling and practical implications developers can make informed decisions
that help balance efficiency and resilience.
