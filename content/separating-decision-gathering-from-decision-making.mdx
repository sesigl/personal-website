In today's fast-paced tech environment, organizations must make swift and effective decisions to stay competitive. However, the quest for perfect consensus often leads to **paralysis by analysis**, stalling progress and innovation. To navigate this challenge, it's essential to **separate decision gathering from decision making**.

## The Pitfall of Seeking Consensus

While inclusive decision-making sounds ideal, aiming for full consensus can be counterproductive. In growing organizations, especially **all-remote companies**, striving for unanimous agreement doesn't scale effectively. It can lead to prolonged discussions, diluted outcomes, and missed opportunities.

At GitLab, they recognize that **consensus doesn't scale**. Instead of seeking unanimous agreement, they focus on trusting their decision-makers and embracing iteration. This approach prevents unnecessary slowdowns and keeps the organization agile.

## Decision Gathering: Harnessing Collective Intelligence

**Decision gathering** is the process of collecting input, ideas, and feedback from team members. It's a critical step that ensures diverse perspectives are considered, fostering innovation and preventing blind spots.

### Best Practices for Effective Decision Gathering

- **Open Communication Channels**: Utilize tools like collaborative documents, forums, or surveys to gather input from all relevant parties.
- **Set Clear Deadlines**: Define timeframes for feedback to keep the process moving.
- **Encourage Diverse Opinions**: Create an environment where team members feel safe sharing unconventional ideas.
- **Document Inputs**: Keep a transparent record of suggestions and considerations for future reference.

## Decision Making: Empowering the DRI

After gathering input, the responsibility shifts to the **Directly Responsible Individual (DRI)**. This person analyzes the collected information and makes the final decision.

### Who Can Be a Decision Maker?

Decision makers are often **tech leads**, **staff engineers**, or individuals with significant experience. However, **mid-level engineers** can also be decision makers. Empowering mid-level engineers promotes growth and diversifies leadership within the team.

#### Reducing the Risk of Poor Decisions by Mid-Level Engineers

- **Mentorship and Guidance**: Pair mid-level engineers with senior mentors who can provide advice without undermining their authority.
- **Clear Decision Frameworks**: Provide guidelines and criteria to help them make informed decisions.
- **Iterative Approach**: Encourage small, reversible decisions that can be adjusted as needed.

### The Decision-Making Process

After gathering input, the DRI should:

- **Review All Feedback**: Thoroughly consider all perspectives and data collected.
- **Evaluate Options**: Weigh the pros and cons of each possibility.
- **Make an Informed Decision**: Choose the option that best aligns with project goals and organizational values.
- **Communicate the Decision**: Clearly explain the reasoning to the team.

#### Is Voting Necessary?

While voting can gauge team preferences, it isn't always the best method for decision-making in this context. Relying solely on votes can:

- **Favor Popularity Over Merit**: The best decision may not be the most popular one.
- **Delay the Process**: Organizing and conducting votes can be time-consuming.

Instead, the DRI should use the gathered input to inform their decision, balancing various factors without being bound by majority opinion.

### Handling Decisions Not Supported by the Majority

It's possible that the DRI's decision may not align with the majority's preference. In such cases:

- **Communicate Transparently**: Explain the rationale behind the decision to foster understanding.
- **Emphasize Organizational Goals**: Highlight how the decision aligns with broader objectives.
- **Encourage Open Dialogue**: Allow team members to express concerns and address them constructively.

#### Should the Decision Maker Seek Consensus?

While considering team input is important, seeking full consensus isn't always feasible or necessary. The DRI should aim for **alignment** rather than consensus, ensuring that team members understand and support the direction, even if they initially disagreed.

## Integrating RFCs and ADRs into the Process

### Role of RFCs (Request for Comments)

- **Structured Feedback**: RFCs provide a formal way to propose ideas and solicit feedback.
- **Documentation**: They create a written record of proposals and discussions.
- **Collaboration**: RFCs encourage input from a wide audience, fostering inclusivity.

### Role of ADRs (Architectural Decision Records)

- **Decision Documentation**: ADRs record the decisions made, along with the context and reasoning.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: They help current and future team members understand why decisions were made.
- **Accountability**: ADRs hold decision makers accountable for their choices.

### How They Fit into the Process

- **During Decision Gathering**: RFCs are used to propose ideas and collect feedback.
- **After Decision Making**: ADRs document the final decisions and the rationale behind them.

By incorporating RFCs and ADRs, organizations can enhance transparency, improve communication, and maintain a historical record of decisions.

## Cultivating a Collaborative Culture

For this separation to work, organizations must foster a culture of trust and collaboration. GitLab embodies this through their **Collaboration** value, which includes:

- **Kindness**: Treating colleagues with respect and understanding.
- **Sharing**: Openly exchanging knowledge and resources.
- **Short Toes**: Being open to others stepping into your domain without taking offense.
- **No Ego**: Prioritizing team success over personal accolades.
- **Assuming Positive Intent**: Believing colleagues are acting in the company's best interest.

## The Benefits of Separation

Separating decision gathering from decision making offers several advantages:

- **Agility**: Enables quicker responses to market changes and internal needs.
- **Innovation**: Encourages diverse ideas without bogging down the decision process.
- **Employee Engagement**: Team members feel heard and valued, boosting morale.

## Overcoming Challenges

Transitioning to this model may feel awkward for those from traditional corporate environments. Here are some tips to ease the shift:

- **Communicate the Change**: Clearly explain the new process and its benefits.
- **Provide Training**: Offer workshops or resources on effective collaboration and decision-making.
- **Lead by Example**: Have leadership demonstrate trust in DRIs and respect for the process.

## Conclusion

Separating decision gathering from decision making is a powerful strategy to enhance efficiency and innovation. By valuing input without being hindered by the need for consensus, organizations can move forward confidently and swiftly. Empowering a range of team members, including mid-level engineers, as decision makers fosters growth and diversifies perspectives. Incorporating tools like RFCs and ADRs enhances transparency and documentation. Embracing this approach, along with fostering a culture of trust and collaboration, positions companies to thrive in the dynamic tech landscape.
