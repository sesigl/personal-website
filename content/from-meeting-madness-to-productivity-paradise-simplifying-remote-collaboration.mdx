Just a year ago, my workday was filled with ambient office chatter, the rhythmic clacking of
keyboards, and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Then, like a whirlwind, the COVID-19 pandemic
swept in and swept away this familiar scene. Suddenly, we were catapulted into the world of remote
work, where the cadence of work was punctuated by back-to-back virtual meetings and the quiet
solitude of home offices.

Navigating through the virtual hallways of remote work has presented its own challenges, especially
in roles where collaboration and communication are the heart and soul of the job. Today, let's
tackle one aspect of this new reality that we've all grappled with: virtual meetings.

Despite the potential meeting overload in the digital sphere, we all strive to strike the perfect
harmony between being an engaged team member and a productive individual contributor.

## Unleashing the Power of Productivity

Aiming for maximum productivity, we might swing towards two extremes: hosting only a bare minimum of
meetings or jam-packing our calendars with constant brainstorming and knowledge sharing sessions.
But beware, these two extremes are treacherous paths to tread.

On one hand, skimping on meetings can lead to misalignment, duplicated efforts, restricted
ownership, and stalled growth. On the other hand, an overflow of meetings can cripple productivity
as our to-do lists burgeon.

## The Meeting Spectrum

In an attempt to find equilibrium, let's segment meetings into these categories:

1. **People Management:** Regular check-ins, feedback sessions, and discussions about personal and
   work-related issues.

2. **Refinement & Ideation:** Brainstorming sessions, planning initiatives, and figuring out the
   nitty-gritty for future actions.

3. **Planning:** Plotting out roadmaps, setting OKRs, planning sprints, and prioritizing for
   efficiency.

4. **Focus:** Sessions that directly contribute to personal or team goals, such as
   brainstorming, code reviews, etc.

5. **Supportive Work:** Lending a hand to someone on a different team or sharing your expertise.

Each of these categories demands a share of our time. Finding the right balance requires a clever
juggling act.

## The Art of Personalizing Your Meeting Balance

Determining the ideal ratio between different meeting categories is not a one-size-fits-all
endeavor. The balance that works best for you could be vastly different from that of a colleague.
The key is personalization â€“ crafting a schedule that aligns with your role, your responsibilities,
and most importantly, your unique working style.

The first step is self-reflection. Assess your work patterns. Are you more productive in the morning
or in the afternoon? Do you perform better with regular short breaks, or are you a marathon worker
who prefers longer periods of uninterrupted work? Answers to questions like these provide valuable
insights to customize your schedule.

Next, consider the nature of your role. A Project Manager may need to allocate more time to planning
and people management meetings, while a Developer might benefit from larger blocks of focus work.

Once you have a preliminary schedule, don't hesitate to tweak it. Initial assumptions might not
always be spot on. If you notice a disconnect between planned and actual productivity, make
adjustments. If certain meetings aren't adding value, speak up or repurpose them. It's a continuous
process of trial, error, and refinement.

## Harmonizing Individuality and Collaboration

While aligning our schedules with colleagues can indeed foster more seamless collaboration, it's
essential to remember that we are not carbon copies of each other. Each team member has their unique
work rhythm, energy peaks, and preferences when it comes to this balance of meetings and focus time.

It may seem like a great idea to have everyone on the team follow a similar schedule for
synchronicity, but enforcing a 'universal' schedule can backfire. The focus hours that work for a
morning person might not be suitable for a night owl. Likewise, the balance between meeting types
that a Manager finds effective may not apply to a Developer.

The beauty of remote work is its potential for flexibility, allowing each of us to work when we're
most productive and energized. This diversity can be a strength if we allow it, leading to different
perspectives and ideas that can enrich our team's collective output.

That being said, it's crucial to maintain a certain level of overlap in team schedules, especially
for meetings that require real-time collaboration. Key touchpoints like planning sessions,
brainstorming, or regular check-ins can be scheduled during the 'common hours' when everyone's
availability intersects.

But outside of these common hours, it's worth embracing the diversity of work rhythms in our team.
Instead of trying to shoehorn everyone into the same mold, let's create an environment where
individual preferences are respected. This approach can boost not only productivity but also job
satisfaction and team morale.

## Hitting the Meeting Sweet Spot For My Needs

Now, let's apply these categories in a real-world scenario. Consider the role of a Tech Lead, where
regular value delivery, planning, refinement, and personal growth are key. Let's break down a
standard 40-hour work week:

- 20 hours for focus work, including coding, pair programming, and code reviews.
- 5 hours for planning and refining to align with team tasks.
- 5 hours for people management, for 1-on-1s with peers and managers.
- 4 hours for supportive work, such as knowledge sharing and team reviews.
- 6 hours for crucial buffers and breaks to keep the productivity engine running smoothly.

We've compiled this into a visual snapshot of a day for a Tech Lead:

| Time  | Activity                                      | Category                            |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 8-9   | Coding, Pair programming, code review         | Focus                               |
| 9-10  | Coding, Pair programming, code review         | Focus                               |
| 10-11 | Daily + brainstorming                         | Supportive Work                     |
| 11-12 | Knowledge sharing, review / External meetings | Knowledge Sharing                   |
| 13-14 | Planning / Refinement / External meetings     | Planning & Refinement & Ideation    |
| 14-15 | Business Strategy & Architecture              | Focus                               |
| 15-16 | Business Strategy & Architecture              | Focus                               |
| 16-17 | 1on1s / External meetings                     | People Management & Supportive Work |

Moving from a haphazard, first-come-first-serve meeting approach to a structured, aligned, and
transparent meeting framework is no small feat. It takes conscious effort, constant refinement, and
practice.

But it's a worthy transition. By embracing this model, we can turn the remote work culture from a
chaotic jumble of meetings into a well-oiled productivity machine.

To get there, try out these actionable tips:

- Use a shared team calendar to ensure everyone's schedule is visible and respected.
- Employ a meeting scheduling tool that allows blocking off focused work times.
- Take short, frequent breaks during high-focus work blocks to maintain energy levels.

remote meetings. Feel free to drop
