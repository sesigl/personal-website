Just a year ago, my workday was filled with ambient office chatter, the rhythmic clacking of
keyboards, and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Then, COVID-19 catapulted us into a new era of
remote work, replacing office buzz with the quiet solitude of home offices and turning face-to-face
meetings into virtual ones.

Navigating the virtual landscape of remote collaboration has posed significant challenges,
particularly where communication and team interaction are key. Let's delve into one aspect of remote
work we've all wrestled with: managing virtual meetings.

In the digital sphere, achieving the perfect balance between effective team collaboration in
meetings and individual productivity can seem like a herculean task.

## Harnessing Productivity in Remote Work

In our quest for optimal productivity, we may veer towards two extremes: limiting ourselves to a
bare minimum of meetings, or overloading our calendars with non-stop virtual brainstorming and
knowledge sharing sessions. Both these approaches are perilous.

On one end, too few meetings can lead to confusion, duplicated efforts, restricted ownership, and
stunted growth. On the other, an overflow of meetings can stall productivity as tasks pile up.

## The Meeting Spectrum in Remote Work

To strike a balance, let's categorize meetings into these types:

1. **People Management:** Regular check-ins, feedback sessions, and discussions about personal and
   work-related issues.

2. **Refinement & Ideation:** Brainstorming sessions, planning initiatives, and tackling the details
   of future actions.

3. **Planning:** Setting roadmaps, defining OKRs, planning sprints, and prioritizing tasks for
   efficiency.

4. **Focus:** Sessions that directly contribute to personal or team goals, such as brainstorming,
   code reviews, etc.

5. **Supportive Work:** Helping someone from a different team or sharing your expertise.

Each of these categories demands our time. Managing them requires a fine balancing act.

## Personalizing Your Meeting Balance in Remote Work

The ideal ratio of different meeting types varies from person to person. Crafting a work schedule
that suits your role, responsibilities, and work style is essential.

Start by examining your work patterns. Do you accomplish more in the morning or afternoon? Do you
prefer short breaks or long periods of uninterrupted work? Your answers can help tailor your
schedule.

Your role also plays a part. For example, a Project Manager might need more time for planning and
people management meetings, whereas a Developer might benefit from larger blocks of focused work.

If your preliminary schedule doesn't quite work, adjust it. It's a process of constant refinement.
If certain meetings don't add value, change them or voice your concerns.

## Balancing Individuality and Collaboration in Virtual Meetings

When managing remote work schedules, it's crucial to remember that each team member has their own
rhythm and preferences when it comes to balancing meetings and focus time.

Forcing a 'universal' schedule can be counterproductive. A schedule that works for a morning person
might not suit a night owl. The meeting types balance that works for a Manager might not work for a
Developer.

One of the advantages of remote work is its inherent flexibility. Let's leverage this by allowing
each person to work during their peak productivity hours.

However, having some overlap in team schedules is crucial, especially for meetings that require
real-time collaboration. These can be scheduled during 'common hours' when everyone is available.

Outside these common hours, embrace the diversity of work rhythms in the team. This approach can
boost productivity, job satisfaction, and team morale.

## Meeting Sweet Spot in Remote Work

Let's apply these categories in a real-world scenario. For

a Tech Lead, the typical 40-hour work week might look something like this:

- 20 hours for focus work, including coding, pair programming, and code reviews.
- 5 hours for planning and refining to align with team tasks.
- 5 hours for people management, for 1-on-1s with peers and managers.
- 4 hours for supportive work, such as knowledge sharing and team reviews.
- 6 hours for crucial buffers and breaks to rejuvenate.

A typical day for a Tech Lead might look like this:

| Time  | Activity                                      | Category                            |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 8-9   | Coding, Pair programming, code review         | Focus                               |
| 9-10  | Coding, Pair programming, code review         | Focus                               |
| 10-11 | Daily + brainstorming                         | Supportive Work                     |
| 11-12 | Knowledge sharing, review / External meetings | Knowledge Sharing                   |
| 13-14 | Planning / Refinement / External meetings     | Planning & Refinement & Ideation    |
| 14-15 | Business Strategy & Architecture              | Focus                               |
| 15-16 | Business Strategy & Architecture              | Focus                               |
| 16-17 | 1on1s / External meetings                     | People Management & Supportive Work |

Switching from an unstructured approach to a well-aligned, transparent meeting framework in remote
work requires effort and constant refinement.

But, by embracing this model, we can transform the remote work culture from a chaotic mishmash of
meetings into a streamlined productivity engine.

Try these tips to get there:

- Use a shared team calendar to ensure everyone's schedule is visible and respected.
- Employ a meeting scheduling tool that blocks off focused work times.
- Take short, frequent breaks during high-focus work blocks to recharge.
